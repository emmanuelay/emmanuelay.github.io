For the longest I've been meaning to publish my own site.
But for some reason I've never taken the time to actually do it. 
I've been journalling for the last couple of years and grown into the habit of collecting my thoughts and ideas in writing.

To publish this i opted to go with something that gives me total control of the html/css and supports markdown for content.

I found [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator built with [Go](https://go.dev), to be just the right tool for the job. It was a bit quirky to get up and running, but once I learned the basics - it was quite pleasant. Github provides the ability to generate and publish Hugo-based websites using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), so I decided to put everything there.

And here we are. A simple enough website, using plain old markdown rendered into handcrafted HTML with a side of my own CSS. Full flexibility and the git-based publishing workflow. I'm finally done.
