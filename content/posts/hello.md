For the longest I've been meaning to publish my own site. 

I've been journalling for the last couple of years and grown into the habit of collecting my plans and thoughts in writing. Its so easy to do today, just write your stuff on Medium or sign up on one of all the 1-click Wordpress hosting solutions.

I've did actually give Wordpress a go, but you know how that ends... I spent a month finding the perfect theme only to discover that it has kinks that I don't like. And when I found a theme I did like and that fit my needs, adjusting the last 1% requires getting my hands dirty in someone elses pile of CSS. Even if that was fixable, the rendered HTML from Wordpress is not.

Clearly I needed to take control over the whole process of putting content into templates and publishing it. Since my content is static and hosting is free on Github - I opted to go with Hugo. That was an experience I expected to be a lot easier than it actually was. I've written a short post about that experience.

And here we are. A simple enough website built with Hugo, using plain old markdown rendered into handcrafted HTML with a side of my own CSS. 

I'm finally done.
