Welcome to my public notepad. This place is an outlet where I write about different things I am undertaking, be it learning new skills, music, books, or programming... my streams of thought.

### Who am I
My name is Emmanuel. I live in Sweden. 
Im an avid techie, and I've been since I got my first computer in the 80's - a Texas Instrument 99. Programming is and has always been my favorite creative outlet, its what I do for fun and also what I enjoy working with.
